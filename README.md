# Termi

(Windows version will be synced at least one in each week)

**From now, non-OpenGL version will not be supported!**

**If you want use non-OpenGL version, manually install files!**

A Powerful Terminal made in C++ with OpenGL and ImGui which own commands

## About Termi
- Termi is a powerful terminal made using C++.
- It can run on Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux.
- Have own commands.
- The goal of Termi is create independent terminal.
- ```Independent``` mean to be independent from terminal in operating system i.e. a separate kind of terminal use "own" GUI renedering system.
- We accept contibutors, create a **Pull Request** to contribute and check [our coding style](https://github.com/ringwormGO-organization/Termi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-sytle-for-pull-requests)
- And plese read [organize part](https://github.com/ringwormGO-organization/Termi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-organization) which talk about directory organization.
- Currently there is only one [stable release](https://github.com/ringwormGO-organization/Termi/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Build & Run
### Required software:
- Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022, ```Desktop development with C++``` and ```.NET 5.0 Runtime``` components (if you use Visual Studio 2022, add support for Visual Studio 2019) - Windows.
- g++ complier - GNU/Linux
  - Install with ```sudo apt-get install g++``` if not already installed on GNU/Linux machine, Debain based.
- build-essential (base-devel for Arch based distors) - GNU/Linux
  - Install with ```sudo apt-get install build-essential``` if not already installed on GNU/Linux machine, Debain based.
- CMake
  - Install with ```sudo apt-get install cmake``` if not already installed on GNU/Linux machine, Debain based.
- Git
  - Install with ```sudo apt-get install git``` if not already installed on GNU/Linux machine, Debain based.
- OpenGL - for OpenGL project part
  - Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=643CUhCoyCo) to install it on GNU/Linux machine, Debain based.

### Build & Run - Windows
- Open ```Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019``` or ```Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022``` and run ```compile.bat``` in `Termi-Windows\Termi\x64\Release` directory.
- Open Termi Visual Studio Solution and compile it.
- If you running application from Visual Studio, loading executables won't work because running from ```Release``` folder/directory isn't same as running from Visual Studio!
- Also you can build launcher and installer for Windows version too :)
- If you want run Termi as standard user, check latest release and download executable or simply clone repo and update it with ```git pull```. You can also use [installer](https://github.com/ringwormGO-organization/Termi/blob/main/Termi-Windows/Installer/Termi.exe) but you need still need to download ```MSVC C++ runtime enviroment```b and ```.NET 5.0 Runtime```. It is recommended that you run the application as an administrator, especially if launcher downloading new update because writing to ```C:\Programs Files``` or similiar directory require administartor priviliges.

### Build & Run (OpenGL)
1. For Windows open Visual Studio solution and compile it. If you compile can't compile project check Victor's video on installing OpenGL (first public video on channel) and video about OpenGL and GLFW.
2. For GNU/Linux (macOS, unsupported) type: ```cmake . && make && ./Termi-OpenGL```. If you can't compile project try with: ```cmake && sudo make && ./Termi-OpenGL```. If you still can't compile project check [this video](hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIbJ5Iw0yAs), check description of video!
