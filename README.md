# Termi
(Termi currently is just a terminal app but we are developing it to be a fully working terminal not just an app)

A Powerful Terminal made in C++

## Build & Run
### Required software:
- Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022 and `Desktop development with C++` components (if you use Visual Studio 2019, add support for Visual Studio 2019) - Windows.
- G++ complier - GNU/Linux
  - Install with ```sudo apt install g++``` if not already installed.
- Git
  - Install with ```sudo apt-get install git``` if not already installed on Linux machine.

### Build & Run - Windows
- Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019` or `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and run `compile.bat`.
- Open Termi Visual Studio Solution and compile it.
- If you want run Termi as standard user, check latest release and download executable or simply clone repo and update it with `git pull`. When you launching installed app, run application as **ADMINISTRATOR**.
- If you run application from Visual Studio, loading executables won't work because running from `Debug` folder/directory isn't same as running from Visual Studio!

### Build & Run - GNU/Linux version (& macOS version which unsupported)
Run `.build.sh`:

```sh
$ chmod +x ./build.sh && ./build.sh
```

### Build & Run - Package Manager
- Enter proper directory and choose command to compile.
#### Windows (MSVC compiler)
Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019` or `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and paste command.

```
cl /EHsc PackageManager.cpp
```

#### Linux (G++ compiler)
